One night I was binge watching YouTube videos, I thought:

  "Wow, there are so many great creators/videos out there ignored by YouTube's
  algorithm!"

I really want the freedom to create, share and protect my own viewing experience,
not just for YouTube, but also for all those websites that profits from creator's
talent without giving them the fair and equal treatment.

I believe that by giving everyone the freedom to create their own algorithm, to
recommend themselves what content they should watch, and to share their perspectives
with others, would create the ultimate equal opportunity platform for everyone.

I want to start 'small':

1. Create a system to document/pull my viewing history from all hosting websites.

2. Create a machine learning model to tell myself what I really watch next
    out of those recommended by the websites.

3. Create a way to intuitively tweak/modify this model.

This 'thing' should:

~ Have two part, a portable back-end and intuitive front-end
~ Able to run local and on a server

This 'thing' shouldn't:

~ Try to recreate youtube or whatever, the main focus should be 'me', not 'how to
  keep me in this site as long as possible'
~ Try to 'cocky', if it doesn't know the answer, just say it

Let's give it a try.
